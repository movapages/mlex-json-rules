### MLEX JSON Rule Set Generation

The present Node.js scripting tool generates a set of rules for a
_home-grown_ tiny **Expert System**. Its _Knowledge 
Base_ system is built from a number of _markdown_ files (actually,
 it's [_Obsidian_](https://obsidian.md/) markdown file format).

The said _Knowledge Base_ JSON files _implement_ (almost 
like an inception engine üòÅ) [JsonLogic](https://jsonlogic.com/), 
having specific syntax for both `facts.json` and `rules.json`.

The actual usage of this rule engine may be seen on
[MLEX.systems](https://www.mlex.systems). Please, keep in mind
this _automatically_ generated rule set, which, on the outside,
looks like _live search_ facility; however, its logic is really
extendable.
