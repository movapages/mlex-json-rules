        "body": "A decision tree classifier is a well-liked and adaptable machine learning approach for classification applications. It creates a model in the shape of a tree structure, with each internal node standing in for a “decision” based on a feature, each branch for the decision’s result, and each leaf node for a regression value or class label. Decision trees are the fundamental components of random forests.\n\nThe Decision Tree Classifier algorithm can be broken down into three main steps:\n\n1. Root Node Selection: The algorithm starts by selecting the root node, which represents the entire dataset.\n2. Feature Selection: At each internal node, the algorithm selects the most informative feature to split the data. This is typically done using a metric such as information gain or Gini impurity.\n3. Splitting: The algorithm splits the data into two subsets based on the selected feature and a threshold value.\n4. Recursion: Steps 2 and 3 are repeated recursively until a stopping criterion is reached, such as a maximum depth or a minimum number of samples.\n\nNB: *Gini impurity* **measures how often a randomly chosen element of a set would be incorrectly labeled if it were labeled randomly and independently according to the distribution of labels in the set**.

These techniques are essential for tasks that involve finding the best path from a starting point to a goal state, such as in navigation systems, game playing, and optimization problems.\n\nHeuristics operates on the search space of a problem to find the best or closest-to-optimal solution via the use of systematic algorithms. In contrast to a brute-force approach, which checks all possible solutions exhaustively, a heuristic search method uses heuristic information to define a route that seems more plausible than the rest.

Both operational behaviors and formal properties of a program are derived using the _language-independent_ proof system of **Matching Logic**.\n\nMore:\n* http://www.matching-logic.org/\n* https://www.numbas.org.uk/behind-the-design/pattern-matching.html\n\n#AI \n#definition \n#article \n#logic-programming "

Subtracting the mean of each observation and then dividing by the standard deviation is the procedure:\n\nThe features will be rescaled so that they have the attributes of a typical normal distribution with standard deviations.\n\n| Normalization                                                                                                                    | Standardization                                                                                                                 |\n| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Objective is to bring the values of a feature within a specific range, often between 0 and 1                                     | Objective is to transform the values of a feature to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1                             |\n| Sensitive to outliers and the range of the data                                                                                  | Less sensitive to outliers due to the use of the mean and standard deviation                                                    |\n| Useful when maintaining the original range is essential                                                                          | Effective when algorithms assume a standard normal distribution                                                                 |\n| No assumption about the distribution of data is made                                                                             | Assumes a normal distribution or close approximation                                                                            |\n| Suitable for algorithms where the absolute values and their relations are important (e.g., k-nearest neighbors, neural networks) | Particularly useful for algorithms that assume normally distributed data, such as linear regression and support vector machines |\n| Maintains the interpretability of the original values within the specified range                                                 | Alters the original values, making interpretation more challenging due to the shift in scale and units                          |\n| Can lead to faster convergence, especially in algorithms that rely on gradient descent                                           | Also contributes to faster convergence, particularly in algorithms sensitive to the scale of input features                     |\n| Use cases: Image processing, neural networks, algorithms sensitive to feature scales                                             | Use cases: Linear regression, support vector machines, algorithms assuming normal distribution                                  |\n\nMore: https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/normalization-in-machine-learning\n\n#ML \n#article \n#normalization\n#standardization\n#definition \n#supervised-ml "

Rational agents can be found in various AI applications, including robotics, automated trading systems, and decision support systems.\n\n## Components of a Rational Agent\n\nA rational agent comprises several key components:\n\n1. ****Perception****: The ability to perceive the environment through sensors.\n2. ****Knowledge Base****: Information the agent has about the environment and itself.\n3. ****Decision-Making Process****: Algorithms and rules that guide the agent’s actions.\n4. ****Action****: The ability to perform actions that affect the environment through actuators.\n\n### Types of Rational Agents\n\n1. ****Simple Reflex Agents****: These agents select actions based on the current perception, ignoring the rest of the percept history. They follow condition-action rules but can be limited in complex environments.\n2. ****Model-Based Reflex Agents****: These agents maintain an internal model of the world, allowing them to handle partially observable environments. They use the model to keep track of the unobserved aspects of the environment.\n3. ****Goal-Based Agents****: These agents take actions to achieve specific goals. They use planning and search algorithms to find sequences of actions that lead to the desired outcomes.\n4. ****Utility-Based Agents****: These agents aim to maximize a utility function that represents the agent’s preferences.

        "body": "Simulated Annealing (SA) is one of the simplest and best-known metaheuristic method for addressing the difficult - unconstrained and bound-constrained - black box global optimization problems (those whose objective function is not explicitly given and can only be evaluated via some costly computer simulation). It is massively used on real-life applications. The main ad- vantage of SA is its simplicity.\n\nThe simulated annealing process starts with an initial solution and then iteratively improves the current solution by randomly perturbing it and accepting the perturbation with a certain probability. The probability of accepting a worse solution is initially high and gradually decreases as the number of iterations increases.\n\nMore:\n* https://www.baeldung.com/cs/simulated-annealing\n\n#AI \n#optimization \n#algorithm \n#definition \n#article \n#simulated-annealing"

        "body": "**Logic programming** has many applications in AI, such as **expert systems**, **knowledge bases**, **natural language processing**, **computer vision**, and machine learning. For example, an expert system is a program that uses logic programming to encode the knowledge and rules of a domain expert, and to provide advice or solutions to users. A knowledge base is a collection of facts and rules that represent the knowledge of a domain, and that can be queried and updated using logic programming. Natural language processing is a field of AI that uses logic programming to analyze and generate natural language, such as parsing sentences, translating texts, or answering questions. Computer vision is a field of AI that uses logic programming to process and understand images, such as recognizing faces, detecting objects, or describing scenes. Machine learning is a field of AI that uses logic programming to learn from data, such as inducing rules, clustering data, or classifying data.\n\nLogic Programming uses facts and rules for solving the problem.

        "body": "### Example CNN Architecture\n\nHere’s an example of a simple CNN architecture:\n\n1. **Input Layer**: 32x32x3 (RGB image)\n2. **Convolutional Layer 1**: 32 filters of size 3x3, stride 1, padding 1\n   - Output: 32x32x32\n3. **Activation Layer 1**: ReLU\n   - Output: 32x32x32\n4. **Pooling Layer 1**: Max pooling with 2x2 window, stride 2\n   - Output: 16x16x32\n5. **Convolutional Layer 2**: 64 filters of size 3x3, stride 1, padding 1\n   - Output: 16x16x64\n6. **Activation Layer 2**: ReLU\n   - Output: 16x16x64\n7. **Pooling Layer 2**: Max pooling with 2x2 window, stride 2\n   - Output: 8x8x64\n8. **Fully Connected Layer**: 128 neurons\n   - Output: 128-dimensional vector\n9. **Output Layer**: Softmax activation for classification\n   - Output: Vector of class probabilities (e.g., 10 for a 10-class problem)\n\n### Key Considerations\n\n- **Convolutional Filters**: Learn spatial hierarchies and detect patterns from the data.\n- **Activation Functions**: Introduce non-linearity, allowing the network to learn complex patterns.\n- **Pooling Layers**: Reduce computational complexity and enhance the network’s ability to generalize by reducing spatial dimensions.\n- **Fully Connected Layers**: Integrate features learned by convolutional layers for final predictions.\n\nThe architecture of CNNs can vary greatly depending on the complexity of the task and the dataset, with deeper networks having more convolutional and pooling layers, and sometimes additional components like normalization layers or dropout layers to improve performance.\n\n#AI \n#CNN\n#CNN-layers\n#definition \n#article "

        "body": "The process of searching in Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a sequence of steps that the AI uses to identify the solution to a given problem. There are two primary types of searches: informed and uninformed. The main difference between the two lies in the amount of information each one utilizes.
